Problem 17: Longest Common Subsequence

Description:
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Example:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace".

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no common subsequence.
