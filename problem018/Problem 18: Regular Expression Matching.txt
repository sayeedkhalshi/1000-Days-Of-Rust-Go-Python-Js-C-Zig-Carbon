Problem 18: Regular Expression Matching

Description:
Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for . and *.

. matches any single character.
* matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string, not partial.

Note:

s could be empty, and contains lowercase English letters.
p could be empty, and contains lowercase English letters, ., and *.
Example:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Input: s = "mississippi", p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern "mis*is*p*." can match the string "mississippi".
