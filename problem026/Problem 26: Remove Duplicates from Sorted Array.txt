Problem 26: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Description:
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Note: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2, respectively.

Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five eleme
