Problem 2: Longest Palindromic Substring

Description:
Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring in it. You may assume that the maximum length of the string is 1000.

A palindromic string is a string that remains the same when its characters are reversed.

Example:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab" (or "aba" is also a valid answer)
