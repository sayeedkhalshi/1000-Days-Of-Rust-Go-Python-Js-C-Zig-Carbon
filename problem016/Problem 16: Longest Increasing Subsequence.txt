Problem 16: Longest Increasing Subsequence

Description:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], which has a length of 5.

Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0, 1, 2, 3], which has a
