Problem 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists

Description:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: l1 = 1 -> 2 -> 4, l2 = 1 -> 3 -> 4
Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

Input: l1 = null, l2 = null
Output: null

Input: l1 = null, l2 = 0 -> 3
Output: 0 -> 3
